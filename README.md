## Quick start
Before using this library, you must ensure that your SourceMod version satisfies the following condition:

**1.10.6480+**
> At least your compiler version is 1.10

I recommend you using 6502+ to use, and stay in the version of 1.10.
> Not recommend you using 1.11+ due to many bugs, and they are unexpected.

At the beginning of your `.sp` file, please specify with following:
```c
#pragma semicolon 1
#pragma newdecls required
```

Then, includes the following pre-requirement lib:
```c
#pragma semicolon 1
#pragma newdecls required

#include <sourcemod>
#include <sdktools>
#include <sdkhooks>

#include <dhooks>
// #include <PTaH> // Optional for you

// #include <cstrike>
// #include ...
```

Next, include the lib
```c
#include <smlib2>
```

By combine of above, it should be looked like this:
```c
#include <sourcemod>
#include <sdktools>
#include <sdkhooks>

#include <dhooks>
// #include <PTaH> // Optional for you

// #include <cstrike>
// #include ...

#include <smlib2>
```

From now on, everything is set, you can enjoy it!
